# Heart Disease Categorical EDA

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset, focusing specifically on **categorical features** such as:

- Chest pain type
- Gender
- Fasting blood sugar
- Thalassemia
- Resting ECG results

# Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

# Insights
- Identified gender-based differences in risk factors
- Visualized class distributions of disease presence vs. categorical attributes
- Helped uncover correlations and outliers in patient profiles

# Dataset
The dataset is from [UCI Heart Disease Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

# How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `heart_disease_eda.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
